# A Simulation in C++ of Joseph Weizenbaum’s 1966 ELIZA

I’ve made in C++ what I think is an accurate simulation of the original ELIZA. It is a console application that takes as input the original format script file, which looks like a series of S-expressions, and then waits for the user to type a line of text before responding with a line of text of its own.

I made this before the ELIZA source code had been found, and wrote about it in [part 1](https://github.com/anthay/ELIZA/blob/master/doc/Eliza_part_1.md).

After the source was found I updated my code and wrote about it in [part 2](https://github.com/anthay/ELIZA/blob/master/doc/Eliza_part_2.md)
